Most big companies and major websites ban external links.

It's understandable. Even though the WWW was built upon links and the digital world was initially free-flowing, now the giants have emerged. Giants try to dominate you, the people,  whether in digital or physical realm. They fence you in, restrict you and your possessions, in order to exploit your labour, attention, thoughts and what ever.

If you comply with their rules, you can gain access, make social connections and receive some payments. If not, you might be banned.  If you post your thoughts on your own small website, there will be very little traffic to it. it's imposible to build a big free domain, it's just a tiny cabin.

How to live in this increasingly closed-off digital world? I think there's still reason to be optimistic. Firstly, we should make an effort to earn real money from the digital world. Comply with the rules of these giants. Since money is good, why not?

Although their rules change arbitrarily and sometimes operate in a black box, and you might unknowingly violate something unacceptable and end up with your account be banned, which is frustrating, you should adapt to this situation as it's quite common in these private digital domain.

Secondly, freely expressing thoughts is still a human right and  human trait. So build your own small website and publish uncensored content that's forbidden by those giants on your site as well as on some other freer websites. They allow you to be yourself, although these may have less traffic, and help you avoid from being molded by the monopoly.

Join the unions of small sites. The WWW is truly vast. Although big companies dominate the mainstream world and flood the surroundings with filtered information, there are still gaps where you can see different things. Just be cautious about them.
