i believe that our time can be divide into four classifications ( this idea isn't new, check out this book [ Five Types of Time ( on Douban ) ](https://book.douban.com/subject/35234117/) ).

the four type of times are enjoyment, exploration, creation, and necessity.


**i.**

creation time is the best type of times. when you are in creation mode, you are fully immersed in making something, nothing can stop you. you have great passion on what you are focusing now, and can work longer, until you are exhausted.

creation time bring a scense of fulfillment. but  it is be luck, not finding.

**ii.**

enjoyment time is when you simply have fun, such as play game, watch vedio and browse the internet at will. these activities require few mental effort, provide dopamine boost, so you will have more similar activities in the future.

they create an information barrier to keep you in one place for too long.

**iii.**

exploration time is driven by your curiosity. you have numerous of reading, unlike the enjoyment time, during exploring, you put things in your head, then do thinking, you will learn something or output something.

it expands you knowledges, make your horizons be wider.

**iv.**

necessity time is the time you have to spend, even if you find it unpleasant. it is your obligations but you lack of passion in them.  it includes work for salary, have terrible social and take care of child for extended periods.

**v.**

be unfulfilled occurs when you aren't doing anything meaningful.  you perceive time as wasted, the feeling  become stronger once the dopamine boost is off. creation time is the solution, but offen you don't find it, it find you.

so it is better to manage your time more effectively, cut off the enjoyment  to properly. set goals that may not enjoyable but will bring benefits, assign tasks in necessity  time and work on them, step by step, day by day, it will lead you to some type of success.
